# This configuration sets up an OpenTelemetry Collector that receives trace data via the OTLP protocol over HTTP on port 4318, applies batch processing, and then exports the processed traces 
# to exporter components like `Jaeger` endpoint located at `jaeger-all-in-one:4317`. It also includes a health_check extension for monitoring the collector's status.

# Receivers in the OpenTelemetry Collector are components that collect telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs) from various sources, such as instrumented applications or agents. 
# They act as entry points, converting incoming data into OpenTelemetry's internal format for processing and export.

# Processors in the OpenTelemetry Collector modify and enhance telemetry data by filtering, transforming, enriching, or batching it to prepare it for export.

processors:
  batch: # Batches logs for better performance

# - Exporters in the OpenTelemetry Collector send processed telemetry data to backend systems like observability platforms, databases, or cloud services for storage, visualization, and analysis.
# - The `key` follows the `type/name` format, where `type` specifies the exporter `type` (e.g., otlp, kafka, prometheus), and `name` (optional) can be appended to provide a unique name for multiple instance of the same type

# - The service section is used to configure what components are enabled in the Collector based on the configuration found in the receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions sections. 
# - If a component is configured, but not defined within the service section, then itâ€™s not enabled.
