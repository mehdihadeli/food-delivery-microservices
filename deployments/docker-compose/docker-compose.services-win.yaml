# We could use also a predefined network and connect to that predefined network with specifying the 'name' of existing network and set 'external' attribute to true
# When we run docker-compose up, Docker Compose will check if the 'food-delivery' network already exists. If it does not exist, it will create the 'food-delivery' network. If it exists, it will use the existing 'food-delivery' network. problem is that if we do a docker-compose down this network will delete and other docker-compose that use same network will fail because network deleted so its better we use `external` keyword for using a predefined network
networks:
  food-delivery:
    name: food-delivery
    driver: bridge
    # we can use the network that will create by infrastructure docker-compose file and we use that network here by specifying existing network 'name' and set 'external' attribute to 'true' (because we want to use a network outside of our docker-compose) or we can create a `food-delivery` network manually by `docker network create -d bridge food-delivery` and use this network as external network for all docker-compose files
    external: true
