// `Faker` has a problem with non-default constructor but `AutoFaker` works also with none-default constructor
// because AutoFaker generate data also for private set and init members (not read only get) it doesn't work properly with `CustomInstantiator` and we should exclude theme one by one, so it is better we use Faker<>
